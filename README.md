# Description
The note-taking app is a web-based application that allows users to create and save notes. Users can access the app through a web browser on their computer or mobile device. The app has two main pages: the home page and the notes page. The home page displays a welcome message and a button to take the user to the notes page. The notes page displays a list of all saved notes, along with buttons to create a new note or delete an existing note. When a user creates a new note, they can enter a title and text content for the note. The app generates a unique ID for the note and saves it to a database. When a user deletes a note, the app removes the note from the database.
